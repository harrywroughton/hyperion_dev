Projects I have completed from my HyperionDev bootcamp:

cafe_app - This application was designed to calculate the total stock of the cafe's menu by using a for loop. It would be useful for a cafe owner seeking efficiency in maintaining stock.

calculator app - This application allows a user to operate a calculator, but also to store the calculations to a txt file, so that they are able to access them at a later date.

finance calculators - This application takes two factors: mortgage/home loan repayments and/or investment interest. A user can use the IDE to input their total mortgage repayment, rate of interest and the years left to pay, to which they will be returned with the total outstanding payment.
Users can also select the investment calculator which will calculate the total interest they will earn on their investment. 

holiday_app - This application acts as a travel agent, allowing a user to select a destination, number of nights in a hotel and number of days renting a car. They will be able to check the total cost of the holiday, as well as the individual costs of each part of it.

triathlon_app - This application allows a user to check what position they have attained in a triathlon. The user fills in the inputs of their swimming, cycling and running times, which the application then adds together (measured in minutes) to provide a result of their earned 'colours'.
